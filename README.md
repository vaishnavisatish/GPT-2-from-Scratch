# üß† GPT-2 from Scratch with Instruction Fine-Tuning

This project implements a GPT-2 language model entirely **from scratch** using PyTorch and pretrained weights. It includes the manual construction of all core components like multi-head attention, transformer blocks, GELU activation, and layer normalization. The model is fine-tuned on instruction-response pairs inspired by the [Alpaca dataset](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) and evaluated using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), achieving an evaluation score of **80**.
